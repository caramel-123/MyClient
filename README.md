## Project Description

Bankero is a decentralized credit scoring and micro-lending platform built on **Stellar** and **Soroban smart contracts**, designed to give unbanked Filipinos a verifiable, on-chain financial identity. By aggregating behavioral signals — loan repayments, wallet activity, community vouches, and anchor-linked remittances — into a transparent 300–850 credit score, Bankero enables peer-to-peer micro-loans without requiring a bank account, payslip, or credit card. The score lives on the blockchain, is owned by the borrower, and is verifiable by any lender, anywhere.

---

## Project Vision

Most of the world's unbanked are not untrustworthy — they're just **invisible** to the formal financial system. Bankero's vision is to make financial reputation portable and self-sovereign: a score earned through real behavior, not institutional gatekeeping.

We believe that if someone has been repaying debts in their community for years, their neighbors know it — even if no bank does. Bankero turns that social trust into verifiable on-chain proof, starting in the Philippines and eventually expandable to any community where peer trust precedes institutional credit.

The long-term goal is a world where any person with a smartphone can walk up to a lender — whether that's a neighbor, an NGO, or a rural cooperative — and say: *"Here is my Bankero score. Here is my history. Verify it yourself on Stellar."*

---

## What is Bankero?

Bankero is a decentralized credit scoring and micro-lending platform built on **Stellar** and **Soroban smart contracts**. It solves a real problem in the Philippines: millions of Filipinos are excluded from formal financial services because they have no credit history — not because they aren't creditworthy.

Bankero builds that credit history **on-chain**, using real behavioral signals:

| Signal | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 🔁 Repayment history | 40% | Loan repayment records |
| 💳 Transaction activity | 25% | Stellar wallet activity |
| 👥 Community vouches | 20% | Peers staking XLM to vouch |
| 🏦 Anchor links | 15% | GCash / Maya / remittance accounts |

The result is a **300–850 credit score** stored transparently on the blockchain — verifiable by any lender, anywhere, without needing a bank statement.

---

## Loan Cycle Walkthrough

A complete end-to-end flow — from a borrower applying for a loan to earning a Credit Certificate after repayment.

### Step 1 — Borrower: Apply for a Loan

The borrower connects their Freighter wallet, checks their current credit score, and submits a loan application. Loan limits unlock automatically based on their score tier — no bank visit, no paperwork.

<img width="1074" height="719" alt="Borrower views credit score on dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64f657d-2088-4ed1-9898-321d674e8525" />
<img width="1021" height="722" alt="Borrower fills out loan application with amount and term" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d152986-63a3-4646-b8d3-0805eb71ff54" />

---

### Step 2 — Lender: Review, Approve, and Disburse

The lender logs into the dashboard and reviews the borrower's full credit profile — score breakdown, repayment history, and community vouches. After approving, the lender disburses XLM directly to the borrower's wallet via Freighter. Every action is recorded on-chain.

<img width="1016" height="716" alt="Lender dashboard showing pending applications with borrower credit scores" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd70249-0d78-40e0-b6d6-f3434c8596db" />

---

### Step 3 — Borrower: Repay and Earn a Credit Certificate

The borrower receives the XLM and repays through the platform before the due date. Each on-time repayment raises their credit score. Once they have repayment history, they can download a **Credit Certificate** — a verifiable, printable proof of creditworthiness backed by Stellar blockchain data.

<img width="1074" height="719" alt="Borrower receives XLM and views active loan details" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9e97c6a-b518-440d-99bb-7cc70ab01f32" />

### On-Chain Transaction Proof

10+ real contract invocations on Stellar Testnet — `update_score` called for multiple wallets, verifiable on Stellar Explorer.

## Transaction Hash (Contract Interaction)

Below is a real testnet transaction from a loan disbursement on Bankero — a lender sending XLM to a borrower's wallet via the platform:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Transaction Hash** | `4ed1ef6bb9ed2c3cf4738417a190fce61cce5cca5b1ed77cbacd35df48907369` |
| **Type** | XLM Payment — Loan Disbursement |
| **Network** | Stellar Testnet |
| **Amount** | 5 XLM (₱500 loan) |
| **Date** | 2026-06-16 10:56:18 UTC |
| **View on Explorer** | [View on stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/tx/4ed1ef6bb9ed2c3cf4738417a190fce61cce5cca5b1ed77cbacd35df48907369) |

---

## Testnet Transaction Demo

When a lender clicks **Disburse**, Bankero:
1. Connects to the lender's Freighter wallet
2. Builds a Stellar payment transaction (borrower receives real testnet XLM)
3. Opens Freighter for the lender to review and sign
4. Submits to Stellar Horizon (testnet)
5. Shows the transaction hash with a link to [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet)

**Conversion rate (testnet):** ₱100 = 1 XLM

---

## Why Stellar?

- **Fast & cheap** — 5-second finality, near-zero fees (perfect for micro-transactions)
- **Soroban smart contracts** — Rust-based, auditable, on-chain logic
- **Anchor ecosystem** — built-in support for connecting real-world assets (GCash, remittances)
- **Freighter wallet** — easy browser extension for Filipino users, no seed phrase complexity
- **Transparent** — every loan, repayment, and vouch is visible on-chain

---

## Score Formula

```
final_score = 300 + (
  repayment_score × 40 +
  tx_score        × 25 +
  vouch_score     × 20 +
  anchor_score    × 15
) × 550 / 10000
```

**Repayment score** uses Laplace smoothing to prevent a single repayment from giving 100%:
```
repayment_score = (loans_repaid / (total_loans + 2)) × 100 − (defaults × 15)
```

---

## User Onboarding

We are collecting real user feedback to guide the next phase of Bankero's development.

### Onboarding Form

**[Fill out the Bankero User Onboarding & Feedback Form →](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4d5o2ryMU9h1_ANlqES3Xr92xnU9Sq4AcS-QUDOZYlJCEiQ/viewform)**

The form collects:
- Full name and email
- Stellar wallet address
- Features used (Borrow / Lend / Vouch / Credit Certificate)
- Overall experience rating (1–5)
- What users liked most
- What users want improved

### Collected Responses

All responses are exported and maintained in:

**[`docs/bankero-user-feedback.xlsx`](docs/bankero-user-feedback.xlsx)**

The spreadsheet is updated as new responses come in and serves as the primary record for product iteration decisions.

---

## Improvement Plan (Based on User Feedback)

The following improvements are planned for Phase 2, informed directly by user feedback collected through the onboarding form:

### 1. Mobile App (React Native)
**Feedback signal:** Users on mobile report the web app is functional but a native app feel is missing.
**Plan:** Build a React Native wrapper using Lobstr wallet for users without desktop browsers. Priority feature for borrowers in rural areas.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

### 2. GCash / Maya Anchor Automation
**Feedback signal:** Users want their GCash history to automatically update their score without waiting for admin verification.
**Plan:** Integrate Stellar SEP-6/24 anchor protocol to automate anchor score updates directly from GCash and Maya transaction history.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

### 3. Simplified Onboarding for Non-Tech Users
**Feedback signal:** New users unfamiliar with Stellar wallets find the Freighter setup confusing.
**Plan:** Add a step-by-step in-app wallet setup guide with screenshots, and an explainer video linked from the dashboard for first-time users.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

### 4. Filipino Language Support
**Feedback signal:** Several users requested full Filipino (Tagalog / Cebuano) UI translation.
**Plan:** Add i18n support with Filipino as the default language option, English as secondary. All CTAs, error messages, and score explanations translated.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

### 5. SMS / Push Repayment Reminders
**Feedback signal:** Borrowers want reminders before their loan due date to avoid accidental defaults.
**Plan:** Integrate Supabase Edge Functions with an SMS gateway (e.g. Semaphore PH) to send repayment reminders 3 days and 1 day before due date.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

### 6. Lender Marketplace
**Feedback signal:** Borrowers want to choose from multiple lenders and compare interest rates.
**Plan:** Build a lender discovery page where borrowers can browse verified lenders, their rates, and specializations before submitting a loan application.
**Commit reference:** *(to be added after implementation)*

---

## Future Scope

Bankero is currently an MVP targeting the Stellar testnet. The roadmap ahead:

### Near-Term (Post-Hackathon)
- **Mainnet deployment** — migrate all 3 contracts from testnet to Stellar mainnet with real XLM
- **GCash / Maya anchor integration** — automate anchor score updates via Stellar SEP-6/24 instead of manual admin attestation
- **Mobile app** — React Native wrapper using Lobstr wallet for users without desktop browsers
- **SMS / USSD fallback** — for users without smartphones, enable loan status checks via text

### Medium-Term
- **Lender marketplace** — multiple lenders compete for borrowers, driving interest rates down through transparency
- **Score decay automation** — scheduled Soroban invocations for inactive wallet score decay (currently admin-triggered)
- **Vouch rewards** — on-chain distribution of the 1% voucher incentive when a borrower repays
- **Group lending** — support for bayanihan-style group loans where repayment responsibility is shared

### Long-Term
- **Cross-border portability** — OFW (overseas Filipino worker) score contributions from remittance corridors
- **Institutional lender API** — let rural banks and MFIs (microfinance institutions) query Bankero scores via REST
- **Reputation export** — let borrowers export their score proof to other DeFi platforms on Stellar
- **DAO governance** — community-governed score weight parameters, replacing admin control with token-weighted voting
